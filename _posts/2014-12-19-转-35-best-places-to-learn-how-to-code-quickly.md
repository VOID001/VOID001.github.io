35 BEST PLACES TO LEARN HOW TO CODE QUICKLY
===========================================


[MARCH 7, 2014](https://web.archive.org/web/20201022012116/http://codecall.net/2014/03/07/best-resources-to-learn-code/) [ROGER](https://web.archive.org/web/20201022012116/http://codecall.net/author/vikas/)

 



Everyone secretly yearns to be an entrepreneur and with the Tech startup industry and opportunities on a boom these days I see more Online start-up companies than real physical ones. As the name suggests a tech start-up means that your business if more often than not online. For such a venture one needs to understand coding and designing. I mean, how can you think of opening a barber shop without knowing how to cut hair yourself.


So if you are not someone that has knowledge about coding and designing can you still get into this business? We say yes! Why not? We will guide you to a few brilliant resources where you can learn the basics as well as advanced level coding and you can sharpen your skills while having fun.


The biggest problem in learning coding and designing is that it was never easy, it requires a lot of time and can be really boring. However, we have a list of online resources and websites that simplify coding and make it look like a child play.


These websites are interactive and use the best practices of learning which means one gains instant interest and does not have to sit through the boring process of learning coding and designing the hard way.


With these websites, you can also interact with like minded people and understand and solve problems which can arise over the period of development.  As it is said, “better safe than sorry”. So even if you are good at coding and designing it is better to understand issues other people face before it starts hurting your business.


I make learning how to code, design very simple for you, and don’t believe me see for yourself.
